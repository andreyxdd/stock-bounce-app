# Stock-bounce: Electron App

<p>
Desktop client to showcase results of the stock markets analysis with bounce algorithm
</p>
<p>The project is built with <a href="https://github.com/andreyxdd/marketeye-api">Market-Eye API</a>, <a href="https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate">Electron React Boilerplate</a>, and <a href="https://mui.com/">MUI</a>.
</p>

## Market-Eye API

MarketEye API provides the most recent stock market analytics by calculating individual stock indicators (EMAs, MFI, etc.) as well as market-as-a-whole parameters (VIX, CVI, etc.) using the end-of-day (EOD) historical data. Market-Eye API stores the last three months of data and computes new analytics every working (trading) day.

*Note*: Market-Eye API is accessible only through a private key access (should be initiated in the ```.env``` locally).
